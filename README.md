# Wifi-Voltmeter
Simple Wifi Voltmeter using ESP8266

I created this code while first learning Arduino and the ESP8266.

Essentially, it leans heavily on the ESP WiFi libraries to create a web server, then on every access of the requested page, read the value of the ADC and output that value in the page served back to the browser.

It's useful because it shows how to include real data in the web page and how to add some kind of task that will run as a consequence of loading the web page.  This was really early code and I've only released it because I was asked to on YouTube (I had forgotten that I had uploaded the video for a couple of friends to see).

If you're using it, good luck - feel free to get in touch via YouTube or here if you can't get it working and I'll try to help.
